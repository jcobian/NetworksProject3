chatinfo.h - contains a struct used by both the client and the server which represents a member
Two subdirectories: client and server
Within client:
	p2pchat.cpp
	makefile
Within server:
	server.cpp
	makefile
To compile run the makefiles within both the client and server sub directories. To run the server simply run ./server <port number>.
To run the client run ./p2pchat student0x.cse.nd.edu:<port>
Functionality of the chat client is the same as in your document. 
Type list to view the list of groups
type join <groupName> <userName> to join group groupName as user userName. If the group does not exist it will be created. 
Type send to initiate sending a message then type your message
Type leave to leave your current group
Type quit to quit the program and gracefully close all connections

Advanced functionality: In addition to the server removing users who have timed out, we also have created a functionality to gracefully quit on their own. If a user manually leaves or quits, the client notifies all necessary parties including the other clients and servers to gracefully close with minimal resource waste.
